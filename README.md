### Modular High-Resolution Virtual Try-On Framework

A modern, modular, and scalable virtual try-on framework built with PyTorch for high-resolution garment transfer, research, experimentation, and rapid development.

</div>

---

# Overview

AuraFit-AI is a clean, modular implementation of a high-resolution virtual try-on pipeline.

The project is organized with a production-oriented architecture to make the codebase easier to understand, maintain, extend, and deploy while keeping training, inference, preprocessing, and evaluation components separated into reusable modules.

The framework supports:

- High-resolution virtual try-on
- Two-stage generation pipeline
- Modular neural network components
- Training workflow
- Inference workflow
- Dataset preprocessing
- Evaluation metrics
- Checkpoint management
- Google Colab compatibility
- Local development
- Research experimentation
